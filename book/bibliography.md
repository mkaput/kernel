# Bibliography

Most of the necessary knowledge needed to create this project was took from two awesome websites:

- [OSDev.org Wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)
- Philipp Oppermann's [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) blog

I have allowed myself to borrow some fixed boilerplate (like initializing long mode) including accompanying commentary.
